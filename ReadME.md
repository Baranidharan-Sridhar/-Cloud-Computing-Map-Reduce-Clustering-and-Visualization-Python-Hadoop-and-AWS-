Instructions:

	Real time Earthquake data containing more than million tuples was used 
	Useful information such as relationship between magnitude and location and other such associations are mined using Hadoopâ€™s Map Reduce.
	
	HadoopTest.java:
		Contains config files to set no of mapper and reducer
		contains mapper class and reducer class initiation
		Input, output file configurations
	HadoopTestMapper.java, HadoopTestReducer.java:
		The input data is split into large no of chunks and calculates the year and precipitation value of the weather data greater than a specified limit,
		in a distributed fashion, which is then given as input to the reducer
		The reducer just summarizes the map data like calculation avg precipitation occured during a particular year span.
